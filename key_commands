git lfs - large file storage > 100mb
when you install git lfs, only do it locally for the specific repository.

git lfs install --local
git lfs uninstall (if you forget local)

# 1: Uncompress tarball

To uncompress them, execute the following command(s) depending on the extension:
$ tar zxf file.tar.gz
$ tar zxf file.tgz
$ tar jxf file.tar.bz2
$ tar jxf file.tbz2

Now change directory
$ ls
$ cd path-to-software/
# 2: Build and install software

Generally you need to type 3 commands as follows for building and compiling software:
# ./configure
# make
# make install (or you can use checkinstall)

From working directory, you add it into the staging index of your repository and committing it actually adds it to the repository.

adding user account and email
git config --global user.name "[name]"
git config --global user.email "[email]"

built-in git GUI
gitk

colorful git output
git config color.ui true

interactive adding
git add -i

Creating a new branch:
git checkout -b [branch name --- gh-pages]
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages [makes the new remote point to gh-pages]
git check master [switches back to original branch]
git branch -d [branch name -- deletes branch]
git push origin [branch]

Adding File to Git:
mkdir [directory name]
go into folder
git init
can also do git init [project name/directory]

Check git status - changes, tracked and untracked files in git repository
git status

Unstages but keeps contents, so undoes the git add
git reset [file]

Deleting the file from directory
git rm [file]

Change name - similar to linux form
git mv [original name] [new name]


Copying Repository to Local:
git clone [repository URL]

Creating a Remote:
git remote add upstream [url] --- where files will be pushed to, typically to personal repository
git remote add origin [url] --- where the files will originate from, typically from outside repository

Check Remote:
git remote --

Way to Add File:
git add [filename]
git commit -> will lead to type in a message can also do git commit -m "commit file"
git push upstream master or git push upstream gh-pages [depending on where you're hosting page]

master - is typically master branch of user's repository
